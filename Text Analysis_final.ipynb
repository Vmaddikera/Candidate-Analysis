      "('Hello, I am Jeffrey Shepherd and I am currently pursuing postgraduate and management from IIM Coikode. I have completed my B.Tech in Biotechnology from Heritage Institute of Technology Kolkata, followed by my M.Tech from IIT Kharagpur. I come with an experience of three years in the regulatory affairs domain of the pharmaceutical industry and I worked as a medical writer in Ciro Klein Farm, Mumbai and have specialized in drug safety and risk management. What sets me apart is the expertise I bring in with my three years of experience and an added two years of postgraduation. Along with this, I add another dimension to the discussion with my background in biotechnology. An added advantage is my ability to pay attention to detail, which is well testamented in my research work and patents, publication and the best research award which my work at IIT Kharagpur has received. After my 12th, I developed a keen interest in baking and over time this has transitioned from a mere hobby into my passion. I love experimenting with traditional recipes and regularly bake for family as well as small functions. I also enjoy traveling, exploring new places, meeting new people and experiencing different cultures. The core competencies which have helped me in my professional career are mainly my consistency. I have consistently excelled in my academics and this perseverance has also helped me grow in my professional career. In addition to this, my ability to pay attention to minutest of details helps me to view a problem from various angles and evaluate and analyze it to come to an effective solution.

In summer 2022, I interned in a boutique investment bank based out of Hyderabad. In this internship, I worked closely with senior professionals. I was involved in developing the framework of a venture network at the ideation stage. This venture network focused on providing funds at the seed level and CD sale levels. I got an opportunity to discuss about startups and what an investor should look for before investing in a startup. And I found this whole process exciting. In addition to this, I interned with a startup known as Kabadi Techno. And in this internship, I regularly discussed the growth of the startups and how a business should be working with the founder. And I used to update my business model accordingly according to our discussions. And my area of focus in this internship was on finance. So I prepared the financial model to get a ballpark figure valuation of the startup. So these two latest internships have provided me a comprehensive view of the company's perspective and an investor's perspective. So now I am looking for a challenging role where I can put my all skills to practice and grow at an acceleration rate. And this is what I am Beside You is providing.

Later on, I gave the undergraduate entrance exam of BHU securing a rank in the top 1.2% and pursued to become honours from Varanasi University, but unfortunately, due to COVID-19, most of my college life was spent online. During my very day days when I had the opportunity to put my foot in the college, I volunteered as a member of the National Service Team, working towards the welfare of the society through small yet powerful steps. During lockdown, I helped in spreading awareness regarding COVID-19 being a part of an event organising committee of my college. I had an internship in a small steel manufacturing firm related to steel furniture in Varanasi as a sales associate to get some practical experience. I also interned in an accounting firm to gain knowledge and learn about the practical applications of accounting in the real world. Apart from my academics, I love to confidently say that I am an excellent guitar player and learned the art of fingerstyle guitar, which at the time was not popular at my place and hence I had to learn from various sources online myself. I also run a small YouTube channel devoted to my passion for music and that is where I upload my own arrangements as well as covers along with tutorials.

From having a consulting experience at Deloitte for three years  after graduating in engineering, I paved my way to an MBA analytics degree to  quench my thirst for exploration into an amalgamation of a world of analytics  strategy and planning. During my time in Deloitte, I worked on end-to-end  validation processes for softwares for pharmaceutical clients. Also, my ongoing  post-graduation in MBA analytics has taken me closer to the field of analytics  in business. To fuel my constant need to take responsibilities, I am a member of  the media and public relations committee of our college. It lets me be a part of  the team who plans to create and apply for a promotion and PR strategies for  the college. I also handle the social media pages of the college. I have been a  content writer and editor for college related activities since graduation. I  love interacting with people and understanding them. The fact that IIM  beside you has a positive attitude towards mental health issues is  really an amazing thing. The company's very idea of trying to understand real  emotions, my increasing affinity towards analytics, my experience in strategizing  as a consultant and my love for learning are the reasons why I want to join this  internship. Thank you!Hello, I am Joseph Nichols. I belong to the heritage city of Varanasi. I have done my undergraduation  in earth science from Banaras Hindu University.

My thorough understanding  of the Indian markets and analytical skills acquired due to working in such a diverse  and rich field such as reinsurance, along with my verbal and written communication skills  are the attributes which I feel make me the right fit for this job. As a person I believe  in the thought that you cannot find newer oceans until you lose sight of the shore.  This thought is something that pushes me each day towards having newer experiences.  While reading about your company and beside you, I understood that you guys want to create a  society where children can live their lives as they are and realize the uniqueness of each person  through artificial intelligence.

Now before joining IIM Co-Ecode, what all have I done? I am a chartered accountant and  I've also cleared CFA level 1. I interned with PWC for more than three years, did my  article shift basically from there and I worked in the statutory audit department. After clearing  CA, I worked with ITC limited in the internal audit department for almost 14 months after  which I joined IIM Co-Ecode for the MBA program. Now a little bit about my skills etc. So I  am a very analytical person. I love playing with numbers, you know, data sets, apply all  sorts of statistical tools, try and understand whatever possible outcomes or interpretations  are there from those numbers. I just love the idea about getting into the edtech space.  Education is something which I believe is the base or the source or basically just the  crux of any economy of the whole, not only the nation, of the whole world. If everyone  is educated, I think the whole problem, I think the major problem will be solved. So  this is the reason I am very fascinated about the idea that your company is providing and  I wish I will be able to expand the successful model that you've built in Japan and bring  that to India as well.

I ran it for 10 months and generated around 1,000 surplus revenue.  Lastly, I was working in an Agritech farm. I was leading a project on the application of remote sensing IoT and artificial intelligence in the field of agriculture and allied sectors.  I am passionate about entrepreneurship and I am always interested in working in new challenging areas, mainly in the business development and strategy domain.  As I am besides you, concentrated on the fact that the online communication is turning like a black box lately and understanding those facial expressions behind the camera is getting harder and harder day by day.  So, having a deep learning algorithm that can analyze the facial expressions and provide a result that is more than 95% accurate will definitely help the civil society for a better human resource development and to maintain a better mental health graph.

I have interned as an Accounting Associate  as well as a Tax Associate wherein I got the chance to apply all the knowledge that I had  learned in my B.Com to apply them in real life scenario. Apart from Academics, I have  been involved in a lot of extracurricular activities. I was the captain of the students  committee in my final school year and was also awarded the Best Student Award at the  end of the year. When I went up to college, I was the class representative which again  is the part of the students committee. Apart from that, I have been a part of Bad Scouts  and Guide for more than 5 years where I have completed several treks and was part of a  lot of activities that were based for social needs and for social cause. In my free time,  I like to read both fiction and non-fiction based on if I am feeling creative that day  or if I want to gain some info. The short term goal for me is to find a job where I  can apply the skill set and the knowledge that I have gained so far and build new skills  alongside. Whereas in the long term, I look for a role wherein I will be able to create  value. I look for bigger targets so that I can test myself. I need to figure myself during  the preliminary years so that when the superior targets are put, I am able to come up with  the best outcomes.\" ]\n",

      "Text: Hello, I am Jeffrey Shepherd and I am currently pursuing postgraduate and management from IIM Coikode. I have completed my B.Tech in Biotechnology from Heritage Institute of Technology Kolkata, followed by my M.Tech from IIT Kharagpur. I come with an experience of three years in the regulatory affairs domain of the pharmaceutical industry and I worked as a medical writer in Ciro Klein Farm, Mumbai and have specialized in drug safety and risk management. What sets me apart is the expertise I bring in with my three years of experience and an added two years of postgraduation. Along with this, I add another dimension to the discussion with my background in biotechnology. An added advantage is my ability to pay attention to detail, which is well testamented in my research work and patents, publication and the best research award which my work at IIT Kharagpur has received. After my 12th, I developed a keen interest in baking and over time this has transitioned from a mere hobby into my passion. I love experimenting with traditional recipes and regularly bake for family as well as small functions. I also enjoy traveling, exploring new places, meeting new people and experiencing different cultures. The core competencies which have helped me in my professional career are mainly my consistency. I have consistently excelled in my academics and this perseverance has also helped me grow in my professional career. In addition to this, my ability to pay attention to minutest of details helps me to view a problem from various angles and evaluate and analyze it to come to an effective solution. Thank you.\n",

      "Text: Hello, I am Cameron Barajas and I am thrilled to apply to this opportunity today. I recently completed my BBA in 2022. I have a flexible attitude. I can lead the team and be a good team player according to the situation. I am a passionate individual who aims for perfection in the task and I always try to give my best and reach the expectations. In summer 2022, I interned in a boutique investment bank based out of Hyderabad. In this internship, I worked closely with senior professionals. I was involved in developing the framework of a venture network at the ideation stage. This venture network focused on providing funds at the seed level and CD sale levels. I got an opportunity to discuss about startups and what an investor should look for before investing in a startup. And I found this whole process exciting. In addition to this, I interned with a startup known as Kabadi Techno. And in this internship, I regularly discussed the growth of the startups and how a business should be working with the founder. And I used to update my business model accordingly according to our discussions. And my area of focus in this internship was on finance. So I prepared the financial model to get a ballpark figure valuation of the startup. So these two latest internships have provided me a comprehensive view of the company's perspective and an investor's perspective. So now I am looking for a challenging role where I can put my all skills to practice and grow at an acceleration rate. And this is what I am Beside You is providing. Hence, I firmly believe that I am Beside You and I am a perfect fit. Thank you.\n",
